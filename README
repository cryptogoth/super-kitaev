Kitaev-Shen-Vyalyi Quantum Compiling Algorithm
http://quantum-compiler.org
==============================================

This is the source distribution for my qualifying project in the Ph.D.
program at the University of Washington Department of Computer Science &
Engineering.

I numerically compared the resource requirements between the Solovay-Kitaev
algorithm (based on the Dawson/Nielsen review paper) and the
Kitaev-Shen-Vyalyi algorithm (based on the 2002 book by the same authors).

Here are the tarball contents:
Makefile       - to automate testing of QCL files, where I worked out exact gate
                 sequences.
adder          - QCL files to test quantum adder circuits
elementary     - QCL files for elementary gate operations
magic-state    - QCL files for manipulating magic states used in KSV algorithm
paper          - LaTeX source files for my quals report.
phase-estimate - QCL files for phase estimation procedure
phase-shift    - QCL files for registered phase shifting
plots          - Excel spreadsheets and CSV raw data for resource counts
python         - Python code to simulate gate resources and produce CSV
scratch        - QCL files for testing / prototypes
utils          - QCL utility files

The QCL code above uses the excellent quantum programming language / simulator
by Bernhard Oemer.

This is just a snapshot of the code at the time I submitted my quals project.
Ongoing development and latest news will be reported at the URL above.
