\section{Abstract}

We describe the technique of parallel iteration of classical finite
automata (FA) to achieve exponential improvement in circuit depth with
only polynomial circuit size overhead. Running an FA on $n$ inputs
normally takes $O(n)$ depth, but by copying the transition function
table, narrowing it by the inputs (known \emph{a priori}), composing
adjacent functions, and then applying composed functions to iterate
the FA on several states in parallel, we can achieve $O(\log n)$-depth.
In particular, we describe how this technique is used for quantum
adding and classical phase sharpening in the Super-Kitaev algorithm
for quantum compiling, giving exact gate sequences and the resource
requirements in each case.
