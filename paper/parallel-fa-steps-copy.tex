\subsection{Copying Input Bits}
\label{subsec:copy}

This is the simplest step and results in $n$ copies of the input bits. Since
these are the control bits for many subsequent operations, if we wish to
source them in parallel, we must have multiple copies. This simply
involves a CNOT to copy each input into an empty ancilla.

We copy in a parallel fashion to achieve logarithmic depth, and each new
copy can itself produce another copy simultaneously. Therefore the circuit depth
is just the height of
a binary tree with $n$ nodes, times two for uncopying later.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|cc|}
\hline
CNOT Gates Per Input &  $\ell_C = $ & $k_i \cdot 2$ \\
Ancillae & & $n\cdot k_i$\\
Circuit Depth & & $(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil - 1 )\cdot \ell_C \cdot d_C$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
