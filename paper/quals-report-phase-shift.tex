\subsection{Registered-Phase Shift}
\label{subsec:phase-shift}

Registered phase shifting is the only use of phase estimation in
Super-Kitaev but it is the most resource-intensive step.
We would like to enact the operator $\Upsilon(e^{-2\pi i / 2^n})$ on
$\ket{\psi_{n,0}}$, which is easy to create, to get $\ket{\psi_{n,1}}$,
which we can later use to enact $\Lambda(e^{2\pi i l / 2^n})$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create the state $\ket{\eta}$ as described in \ref{subsec:magic-state}.
\item Measure $k$ by determining the phase $\phi_k = k/2^n$ with precision
$\delta = 2^{-n}$ by using phase estimation. One of the $n$-qubit registers
now contains $\ket{\psi_{n,k}}$ for some fixed $k$.
This is done by parallelized phase estimation described in
\ref{subsec:ppe}.
This is done by a circuit of size $O(n^2)$ and depth $O(\log n)$.
\item Solve for $p$ in equation
Equation \ref{eqn:psl} using modular division, described in
\ref{subsec:div}.
\item Apply $A^p$ to the $n$-qubit register containing $\ket{\psi}$, which
enacts the desired phase shift.
\end{enumerate}
