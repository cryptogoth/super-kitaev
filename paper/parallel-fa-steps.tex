\section{Parallel Iterations}
\label{sec:pi}

The process of parallelizing iterations has four main steps, each of which
has its own section below with general resource requirements.

The first step is copying function tables due to fanout restrictions.
For classical circuits this is a polite gesture towards the fact that
transistors can only drive a finite (but fairly large) load. For quantum
circuits, this is an absolute necessity. So if we are going to be applying
a bunch of FA transition functions in parallel, we'd better have a separate
copy of the function for each execution.

The second step is narrowing the function tables by input. Since we know all
the input symbols in advance, we can vastly simplify the table for each
iteration $i$ by only selecting the lines which correspond to the input
symbol $a_i$. In a sense, we are ``optimizing'' the table, or hard-coding
for a particular input symbol by ``baking'' it into the execution of this new,
narrower function.

The third step is composing adjacent pairs of these narrowed function tables
in a binary tree hierarchy, so that we can skip ahead to future iterations.

Finally, the last step is to apply these composed function tables, in the
same binary tree hierarchy, to compute all the states $s_i$ in parallel
using only logarithmic depth.
